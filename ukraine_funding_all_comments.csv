Umm, biolabs in Ukraine???? Undeniable evidence. Irrefutable. 

""It's just biological research, nothing more"" 

Then why lie about the labs in the first place? 

""Russia may try disinformation campaigns about the labs and/or release biological weapons (not from our labs)"" 

Then why are you so afraid of Russia encroaching on the labs? Particularly when I'm sure they have biological labs of their own with their own research and viruses, why would they need to invade Ukraine for it? 

Maybe for something that they wouldn't have in their own labs. 

Perhaps evidence of a global bid for control and power, which if said evidence was provided would not be difficult to believe due to a massive amount of distrust in our leaders, media, and the establishment. 

I say we wait to see what they've found, and see how our government/media responds to that.

by Tina Redlup on June 18, 2010

Sen. Dick Lugar

U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar applauded the opening of the Interim Central Reference Laboratory in Odessa, Ukraine, this week, announcing that it will be instrumental in researching dangerous pathogens used by bioterrorists.

The level-3 bio-safety lab, which is the first built under the expanded authority of the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program, will be used to study anthrax, tularemia and Q fever as well as other dangerous pathogens.

“The continuing cooperation of Nunn-Lugar partners has improved safety for all people against weapons of mass destruction and potential terrorist use, in addition to advancements in the prevention of pandemics and public health consequences,” Lugar said.

Lugar said plans for the facility began in 2005 when he and then Senator Barack Obama entered a partnership with Ukrainian officials. Lugar and Obama also helped coordinate efforts between the U.S and Ukrainian researchers that year in an effort to study and help prevent avian flu.

## This is the most documented genocide in history.

## Reddit's blatant censorship of Palestinian-related content is appalling, especially concerning the ongoing genocide in Gaza perpetrated by the Isr\*l apartheid regime.

## The Palestinian people are facing an unimaginable tragedy, with tens of thousands of innocent children already lost to the genocidal actions of apartheid Isr\*l. The world needs to know about this atrocity and about Reddit's support to the ZioN\*zis.

#### Sources are bellow.

## Genocidal statements made by apartheid Isr\*li officials:

- On the 9 October 2023, Yoav Gallant, Israeli Minister of Defense, stated **""We are fighting human animals, and we are acting accordingly""**.
- Avi Dichter, Israeli Minister of Agriculture, called for the war to be **""Gaza’s Nakba""**
- Ariel Kallner, another Member of the Knesset from the Likud party, similarly wrote on social media that there is **""one goal: Nakba! A Nakba that will overshadow the Nakba of 1948. Nakba in Gaza and Nakba to anyone who dares to join""**.
- Amihai Eliyahu, Israeli Minister of Heritage, **called for dropping an atomic bomb on Gaza**
- Gotliv of the Likud party similarly **called for the use of nuclear weapons**.
- Yitzhak Kroizer stated in a radio interview that the **""Gaza Strip should be flattened, and for all of them there is but one sentence, and that is death.""**
- **President of Israel** Isaac Herzog **blamed the whole nation of Palestine** for the 7 October attack.
- Major General Ghassan Alian, Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories, stated: **""There will be no electricity and no water (in Gaza), there will only be destruction. You wanted hell, you will get hell""**.

## Casualties:

- As of 9 January 2024, over **23,000 Palestinians** – one out of every 100 people in Gaza – have been killed, a majority of them civilians, including over **9,000 children**, **6,200 women** and **61 journalists**.
- nearly **2 million people** have been displaced within the Gaza Strip.

## Official accusations:

- On 1 November, the Defence for Children International accused the United States of complicity with Israel's **""crime of genocide.""**
- On 2 November 2023, a group of UN special rapporteurs stated, ""We remain convinced that the Palestinian people are at **grave risk of genocide**.""
- On 4 November, Pedro Arrojo, UN Special Rapporteur on the Human Rights to Safe Drinking Water and Sanitation, said that based on article 7 of the Rome Statute, which counts ""deprivation of access to food or medicine, among others"" as a form of extermination, ""even if there is no clear intention, the data show that the war is **heading towards genocide**""
- On 16 November, A group of United Nations experts said there was ""evidence of increasing genocidal incitement"" against Palestinians.
- Jewish Voice for Peace stated: ""The Israeli government has declared a genocidal war on the people of Gaza. As an organization that works for a future where Palestinians and Israelis and all people live in equality and freedom, we call on all people of conscience to stop imminent **genocide of Palestinians**.""
- Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor documented evidence of execution committed by Israeli Defense Forces.
- In response to a Times of Israel report on 3 January 2024 that the Israeli government was in talks with the Congolese government to take Palestinian refugees from Gaza, UN special rapporteur Balakrishnan Rajagopal stated, ""Forcible transfer of Gazan population **is an act of genocide**"".

South Africa has instituted proceedings at the International Court of Justice pursuant to the Genocide Convention, to which both Israel and South Africa are signatory, **accusing Israel of committing genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity against Palestinians in Gaza.**

too modest and, with the exception of the 2005 release related to Hurricane Katrina, too late to produce significant benefits. 

The SPR is best conceptualized as a publicly provided insurance policy against petroleum market shocks. The cost of the SPR program is the premium. The benefits are the price reductions that result from its existence or use.

The SPR, however, provides insurance against only a subset of the possible supply disruptions that could occur. Oil releases from the SPR can improve *temporary* events but cannot affect long-term disruptions in the market because the reserves are not large enough to affect world prices over extended periods of time.

The cost of maintaining the SPR exceeds oil prices that we observe even during shocks. If it were shut down, we could
avoid paying for it during good times and simply pay market prices during shocks. Instead we now pay both the costs of the SPR and market prices during shocks.",FALSE,Reasonable_Mess_3327

One which could very easily end with nuclear warfare. An ideal end to this conflict would be a Ukrainian victory with no NATO involvement beyond funding and military aid.

Failing that victory, even a loss for Ukraine that still bleeds Russia dry in a years-long conflict is preferable to a smooth and easy victory.
